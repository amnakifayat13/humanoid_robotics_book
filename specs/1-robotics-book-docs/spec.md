## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - New Learner Onboarding (Priority: P1)

A new learner, with foundational programming knowledge but limited robotics experience, seeks to understand the core concepts of humanoid robotics and physical AI. They navigate the book sequentially, understanding complex topics through clear explanations, diagrams, and practical examples, eventually grasping the interconnections between software, simulation, and AI for robot control.

**Why this priority**: Crucial for broad accessibility and effective knowledge transfer to the target audience. A successful onboarding experience drives engagement and learning.

**Independent Test**: The learner can follow each module's chapters, complete embedded exercises/code samples, and demonstrate understanding of the module's learning outcomes by summarizing key concepts or explaining a practical application.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a new learner starts with Module 1, **When** they complete Module 1, **Then** they can explain ROS 2 fundamentals and URDF modeling.
2. **Given** a learner progresses through all modules, **When** they reach the Capstone project in Module 4, **Then** they can articulate the VLA architecture and its components.

---

### User Story 2 - Experienced Developer Upskilling (Priority: P2)

An experienced software developer or roboticist, familiar with existing tools but new to specific frameworks (e.g., NVIDIA Isaac, LLM integration), seeks targeted information to upskill. They can quickly find relevant modules and chapters, focusing on practical implementation details, advanced concepts, and bridging existing knowledge with new technologies.

**Why this priority**: Caters to a segment of the audience looking for specific knowledge, enabling them to integrate new technologies into their existing projects.

**Independent Test**: The developer can jump to a specific chapter (e.g., Isaac ROS for VSLAM), implement a sample code snippet based on the chapter's content, and integrate it successfully into a mock project environment.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an experienced developer needs to learn about Unity for robot rendering, **When** they navigate to the relevant chapter in Module 2, **Then** they can find code examples and configurations for integrating Unity with Gazebo.
2. **Given** a developer wants to implement LLM-based cognitive planners, **When** they read Module 4, **Then** they can identify the necessary libraries and architectural patterns for converting natural language to ROS 2 tasks.

### Edge Cases

- What happens if a learner has no prior programming experience? - The book assumes foundational programming knowledge; a prerequisite section will clarify this.
- How does the book address rapid advancements in AI/robotics? - The book is designed with modularity, allowing individual chapters/modules to be updated or expanded without affecting the entire structure. Versioned documentation is the strategy.
