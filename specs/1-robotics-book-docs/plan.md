# Implementation Plan: Robotics & Physical AI Book Documentation

**Branch**: `1-robotics-book-docs` | **Date**: 2025-12-04 | **Spec**: specs/1-robotics-book-docs/spec.md
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/1-robotics-book-docs/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/sp.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

This plan outlines the development of a comprehensive Docusaurus-based book on robotics, humanoid systems, physical AI, and embodied intelligence. The book will be structured into four main modules: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2), The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity), The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac), and Vision-Language-Action (VLA). The technical approach focuses on creating clear, structured, and interactive documentation, leveraging Docusaurus features for seamless navigation and rich content presentation, including code examples, diagrams, and glossary terms.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: Markdown for content, JSON for Docusaurus configuration (`_category_.json`). Code examples within the book will primarily use Python (e.g., `rclpy`, LLM integration) with potential for C++ (for ROS 2 concepts).
**Primary Dependencies**: Docusaurus (for static site generation and documentation framework), ROS 2 (for robot middleware and control), Gazebo (for physics simulation), Unity (for high-fidelity rendering), NVIDIA Isaac Sim/ROS (for advanced simulation and perception), Nav2 (for humanoid path planning), Whisper (for speech-to-text), and relevant LLM frameworks for cognitive planning.
**Storage**: All documentation content (Markdown files) and Docusaurus configuration (JSON files) will be stored within the `book-site/docs/` directory of the repository.
**Testing**: Manual review will be performed for clarity, accuracy, and adherence to Docusaurus structural standards. Automated checks will be implemented for broken links and the execution/verification of code examples (requires a separate testing suite).
**Target Platform**: The final book will be a static website accessible via web browsers, generated by Docusaurus. Users will interact with the content through a standard web interface.
**Project Type**: Documentation project, specifically a Docusaurus static site within a larger software development context.
**Performance Goals**: The Docusaurus site should load quickly, offer smooth navigation, and embedded code examples should execute efficiently in user environments to ensure a positive learning experience.
**Constraints**: The project must strictly adhere to the Docusaurus folder structure and front-matter conventions. It requires detailed chapter outlines, explicit cross-module references, recommended diagrams/images per chapter, and a comprehensive glossary for each module.
**Scale/Scope**: The project encompasses a multi-module technical book designed to educate a broad audience, from beginners to experienced developers, on a wide range of topics within humanoid robotics and physical AI.

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

Based on the `.specify/memory/constitution.md` file:
- **I. Accuracy**: The plan prioritizes factual verification for all robotics/AI content and code examples.
- **II. Coherence**: The book's structure is designed for consistent writing style and a clear, structured progression from basic to advanced topics.
- **III. Modularity**: The modular design (separate modules and chapters) inherently allows for individual content improvements and updates.
- **IV. Transparency**: Methodologies and technical explanations will be transparently communicated within the chapters.
- **V. Safety**: Ethical implications of humanoids and embodied AI will be addressed in relevant sections, particularly in Module 4.
- **VI. Creativity with Discipline**: The plan encourages creative content presentation (diagrams, examples) while maintaining strict adherence to technical accuracy and documentation standards.

All principles are respected and will guide the documentation process.

### Source Code (repository root)

The core project is primarily documentation. No direct modifications to the main repository's source code structure are required by this plan. Code examples will be embedded or referenced within the markdown documentation.

**Structure Decision**: The documentation structure is explicitly defined within the `spec.md` and will be implemented directly under `book-site/docs/`. No new application code structure is part of this feature.
