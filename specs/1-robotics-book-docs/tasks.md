# Tasks: Robotics & Physical AI Book Documentation

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/1-robotics-book-docs/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), spec.md (required for user stories)

**Tests**: No specific test tasks are explicitly requested in the feature specification for this documentation project; however, verification tasks are included to ensure content quality and Docusaurus compliance.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and review of each content module.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions

- All documentation files will be created under `book-site/docs/` as specified in the plan.

## Phase 1: Setup (Docusaurus Structure & Configuration)

**Purpose**: Initialize the Docusaurus book structure and global configuration files.

- [X] T001 Create root `book-site/docs/intro.md` for book introduction
- [X] T002 Create root `book-site/docs/_category_.json` for overall book sidebar
- [X] T003 Create `book-site/docs/module1/_category_.json` for Module 1 sidebar
- [X] T004 Create `book-site/docs/module2/_category_.json` for Module 2 sidebar
- [X] T005 Create `book-site/docs/module3/_category_.json` for Module 3 sidebar
- [X] T006 Create `book-site/docs/module4/_category_.json` for Module 4 sidebar

---

## Phase 2: Foundational (Cross-cutting Content & Verification)

**Purpose**: Establish core content elements and validation mechanisms that span across modules.

**⚠️ CRITICAL**: Content creation for individual modules can begin after this phase.

- [X] T007 Define global glossary terms and ensure consistency across modules in a central location (e.g., `book-site/docs/glossary.md`)
- [X] T008 Implement a strategy for cross-module referencing and linking within Docusaurus
- [X] T009 Set up automated checks for broken links across all generated `.md` files in `book-site/docs/`

**Checkpoint**: Foundation ready - module content creation can now begin in parallel

## Phase 3: User Story 1 - New Learner Onboarding (Priority: P1) 🎯 MVP

**Goal**: New learners can sequentially navigate and comprehend the book's content, building foundational knowledge in robotics and physical AI.

**Independent Test**: A learner can follow each module's chapters, complete embedded exercises/code samples, and demonstrate understanding of the module's learning outcomes by summarizing key concepts or explaining a practical application.

### Implementation for Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)

- [X] T010 [P] [US1] Write `book-site/docs/module1/chapter1-ros2-nodes-topics-services.md` with content outline and Docusaurus front-matter
- [X] T011 [P] [US1] Write `book-site/docs/module1/chapter2-python-agents-rclpy.md` with content outline and Docusaurus front-matter
- [X] T012 [P] [US1] Write `book-site/docs/module1/chapter3-urdf-humanoid-modeling.md` with content outline and Docusaurus front-matter

### Implementation for Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)

- [X] T013 [P] [US1] Write `book-site/docs/module2/chapter1-gazebo-physics-simulation.md` with content outline and Docusaurus front-matter
- [X] T014 [P] [US1] Write `book-site/docs/module2/chapter2-unity-high-fidelity-rendering.md` with content outline and Docusaurus front-matter
- [X] T015 [P] [US1] Write `book-site/docs/module2/chapter3-sensor-simulation.md` with content outline and Docusaurus front-matter

### Implementation for Module 3: The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac)

- [ ] T016 [P] [US1] Write `book-site/docs/module3/chapter1-isaac-sim-photorealistic.md` with content outline and Docusaurus front-matter
- [ ] T017 [P] [US1] Write `book-site/docs/module3/chapter2-isaac-ros-vslam-navigation.md` with content outline and Docusaurus front-matter
- [ ] T018 [P] [US1] Write `book-site/docs/module3/chapter3-nav2-humanoid-path-planning.md` with content outline and Docusaurus front-matter

### Implementation for Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA)

- [ ] T019 [P] [US1] Write `book-site/docs/module4/chapter1-whisper-voice-commands.md` with content outline and Docusaurus front-matter
- [ ] T020 [P] [US1] Write `book-site/docs/module4/chapter2-llm-cognitive-planners.md` with content outline and Docusaurus front-matter
- [ ] T021 [P] [US1] Write `book-site/docs/module4/chapter3-capstone-autonomous-humanoid.md` with content outline and Docusaurus front-matter

**Checkpoint**: At this point, all core content for new learner onboarding should be present and navigable.

---

## Phase 4: User Story 2 - Experienced Developer Upskilling (Priority: P2)

**Goal**: Experienced developers can efficiently locate and apply specific advanced technical solutions from the book.

**Independent Test**: A developer can jump to a specific chapter (e.g., Isaac ROS for VSLAM), implement a sample code snippet based on the chapter's content, and integrate it successfully into a mock project environment.

### Content Refinement for Experienced Developers

- [ ] T022 [P] [US2] Review and enhance code examples in all modules for robustness and practical application (`book-site/docs/moduleX/chapterY.md`)
- [ ] T023 [P] [US2] Add advanced insights and troubleshooting tips to relevant chapters (`book-site/docs/moduleX/chapterY.md`)
- [ ] T024 [P] [US2] Integrate more in-depth cross-references to relevant academic papers and advanced topics in all modules (`book-site/docs/moduleX/chapterY.md`)

**Checkpoint**: All user stories should now be independently functional.

---

## Phase N: Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns

**Purpose**: Final review for consistency, grammar, Docusaurus compliance, and overall quality.

- [ ] T025 [P] Conduct comprehensive grammar, spell, and style checks across all documentation files in `book-site/docs/`
- [ ] T026 Verify all Docusaurus `_category_.json` and front-matter configurations are correct and render as intended
- [ ] T027 Run automated broken link checker and resolve any identified issues in `book-site/docs/`
- [ ] T028 Final content review against success criteria (SC-001 to SC-005) for overall quality and completeness
- [ ] T029 (Optional) Integrate quizzes or self-assessment questions at the end of each module/chapter

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all content creation for modules.
- **User Stories (Phase 3+)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion.
  - User Story 1 (P1) and User Story 2 (P2) can proceed largely in parallel, with P2 focusing on enhancements to the content created in P1.
- **Polish (Final Phase)**: Depends on all user stories' content being substantially complete.

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: No dependencies on other stories, but foundational to all subsequent learning.
- **User Story 2 (P2)**: Builds upon the core content established in User Story 1.

### Within Each User Story

- Chapter content tasks (T010-T021) within User Story 1 can be parallelized by module and chapter.
- Content refinement tasks (T022-T024) within User Story 2 can be parallelized across different files.

### Parallel Opportunities

- All tasks within Phase 1 (T001-T006) for creating Docusaurus structural files can be executed in parallel.
- Within User Story 1, the writing of individual chapter files (T010-T021) is highly parallelizable.
- Within User Story 2, content refinement tasks (T022-T024) are largely parallelizable across different documentation files.
- Many tasks in the Polish phase (T025, T027) can be run in parallel, while T026 and T028 might require sequential review.

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 1 (Module 1 Chapters)

```bash
# Launch creation of Module 1 chapters in parallel:
Task: "Write book-site/docs/module1/chapter1-ros2-nodes-topics-services.md"
Task: "Write book-site/docs/module1/chapter2-python-agents-rclpy.md"
Task: "Write book-site/docs/module1/chapter3-urdf-humanoid-modeling.md"
```

---

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Core Content)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup (T001-T006)
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (T007-T009)
3. Complete User Story 1 content creation (T010-T021)
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Ensure all core chapters are navigable, accurate, and meet basic clarity requirements.
5. Deploy/demo if ready (as an early access version).

### Incremental Delivery (Adding User Story 2 and Polish)

1. Complete MVP (User Story 1 content).
2. Add User Story 2 enhancements (T022-T024) - focusing on advanced details and code robustness.
3. Perform Phase N: Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns (T025-T029).
4. Each increment adds value and refines the documentation.

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple writers/developers:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together.
2. Once Foundational is done:
   - Writer A: Module 1 & 2 content (P1)
   - Writer B: Module 3 & 4 content (P1)
   - Reviewer C: Focus on User Story 2 enhancements and Polish tasks (P2, Phase N)
3. Content creation and refinement proceed in parallel, with regular integration and review.

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, minimal immediate dependencies, highly suitable for parallel work.
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability and incremental delivery.
- Each user story's content should be independently completable and verifiable for clarity and accuracy.
- Verify automated link checks pass before final deployment.
- Commit after each task or logical group of related tasks.
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate the quality and completeness of the documentation increment.
- Avoid: Vague content requirements, inconsistent Docusaurus configurations, breaking existing links during updates.
