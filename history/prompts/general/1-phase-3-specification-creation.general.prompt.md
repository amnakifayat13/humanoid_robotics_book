# Phase 3 Specification Creation

## User Input
```
write specification for phase_3.md from @project_workflow\
```

## Response Summary
Created a comprehensive specification for Phase 3 of the RAG chatbot project, which focuses on frontend ChatKit integration with the Docusaurus book site. The specification includes:

- User scenarios prioritized by importance (P1-P3)
- Functional requirements (FR-001 through FR-010)
- Success criteria (SC-001 through SC-006)
- Edge cases for error handling
- Key entities definition

The specification covers the integration of ChatKit with the backend API endpoints, handling both full documentation queries and selected text interactions, while maintaining conversation state across page navigation.

## Outcome
Successfully created a complete specification document and quality checklist that is ready for the planning phase. The specification follows the template structure and meets all quality criteria without implementation-specific details, focusing on user value and business needs.
