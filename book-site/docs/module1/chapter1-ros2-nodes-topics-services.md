# Chapter 1: ROS 2 Nodes, Topics, and Services

## Introduction

- Overview of ROS 2 as the Robotic Nervous System.
- Importance of ROS 2 for humanoid robot control.

## ROS 2 Nodes

- What are ROS 2 nodes? (single-purpose executables)
- How nodes communicate (loosely coupled).
- Basic node creation in Python and C++ (conceptual).

## ROS 2 Topics

- Publish/Subscribe communication model.
- Data flow and message types.
- Example: Robot sensor data (e.g., IMU, LiDAR) being published.
- Exercise: Create a simple publisher and subscriber.

## ROS 2 Services

- Request/Response communication model.
- Use cases: Triggering actions, querying information.
- Example: Commanding a robot arm to move to a position, receiving status.
- Exercise: Create a simple service client and server.

## Conclusion

- Recap of ROS 2 communication primitives.
- Foundation for building complex robotic behaviors.
