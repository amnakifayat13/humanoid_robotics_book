# Chapter 3: URDF for Humanoid Robot Modeling

## Introduction

- Importance of robot description formats.
- Introduction to URDF (Unified Robot Description Format).
- Role of URDF in simulation and visualization.

## URDF Fundamentals

- Links: Representing rigid bodies (e.g., torso, limbs).
- Joints: Defining connections and motion between links (e.g., revolute, prismatic).
- Coordinate frames and transformations.

## Creating a Simple Humanoid URDF

- Step-by-step guide to building a basic humanoid robot model.
- Defining visual and collision properties.
- Adding inertial properties for physics simulation.

## Extending URDF with Xacro

- Introduction to Xacro for modular and parametric robot descriptions.
- Reusability and readability benefits.
- Exercise: Refactor the simple humanoid URDF using Xacro macros.

## Visualization and Validation

- Using  to visualize the URDF model.
- Checking for common errors and inconsistencies in the robot description.

## Conclusion

- Mastering URDF for accurate robot modeling.
- Foundation for simulating and controlling complex humanoid systems.
