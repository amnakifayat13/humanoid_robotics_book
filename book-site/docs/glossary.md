# Glossary of Robotics & Physical AI Terms

This glossary defines key terms used throughout the book to ensure consistency and clarity.

## A

**Actuator**: A component of a machine that is responsible for moving or controlling a mechanism or system. (e.g., electric motors, hydraulic cylinders)

## C

**Cognitive Planner**: An AI system, often powered by Large Language Models (LLMs), that translates high-level natural language goals into a sequence of actionable steps for a robot.

## D

**Digital Twin**: A virtual model of a physical object, process, or system. Used for simulation, analysis, and monitoring.

## G

**Gazebo**: An open-source 3D robotics simulator that accurately simulates rigid body physics, sensor feedback, and environments.

## H

**Humanoid Robot**: A robot designed to resemble the human body, often with a torso, head, two arms, and two legs.

## I

**IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit)**: An electronic device that measures and reports a body's specific force, angular rate, and sometimes the orientation of the body, using a combination of accelerometers, gyroscopes, and sometimes magnetometers.

**Isaac ROS**: A collection of hardware-accelerated packages for ROS 2 that bring NVIDIA's AI and robotics technologies to autonomous systems.

**Isaac Sim**: A scalable robotics simulation application and development platform that makes it easy to create physically accurate virtual worlds.

## L

**LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging)**: A remote sensing method that uses pulsed laser to measure ranges (variable distances) to the Earth.

**LLM (Large Language Model)**: A type of artificial intelligence program that can recognize and generate text, among other tasks.

## N

**Nav2**: A navigation framework for ROS 2, providing a complete stack for robot navigation in complex environments.

**Node (ROS 2)**: An executable process in ROS 2 that performs a specific task. Nodes communicate with each other using topics, services, and actions.

## R

**rclpy**: The Python client library for ROS 2, providing an interface to interact with ROS 2 concepts like nodes, topics, and services.

**ROS 2 (Robot Operating System 2)**: An open-source middleware for robotics that provides a standardized way for different software components to communicate and interact.

## S

**Sensor Simulation**: The process of mimicking the output of physical sensors in a simulated environment, crucial for developing and testing robot perception algorithms.

**Service (ROS 2)**: A request/response communication mechanism in ROS 2, used for calling a specific function and getting a result.

## T

**Topic (ROS 2)**: A publish/subscribe communication mechanism in ROS 2, used for streaming data between nodes.

## U

**Unity**: A cross-platform game engine used for developing video games, simulations, and other interactive experiences, including high-fidelity robotics visualization.

**URDF (Unified Robot Description Format)**: An XML file format used in ROS to describe all aspects of a robot, including its visual appearance, collision properties, and inertial properties.
